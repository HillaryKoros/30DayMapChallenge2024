## How to Participate

The idea is to create maps based on the different themes each day of November using the hashtag **#30DayMapChallenge**. You can prepare the maps in advance, but the main goal is to publish them on the designated days. Simply include a picture of your map when you post to platforms like X, Instagram, or LinkedIn.

### Participation Guidelines

- All maps must be your original work. Give credit to the original data source whenever possible.
- This challenge is about creativity, openness, and the joy of beautiful maps and cartography; it is not a competition.
- Be mindful when using AI tools—if you generate all maps with generative AI, where's the fun?
- Treat others with respect. Harassment or stealing from others is not tolerated.

## Inspiration

The inspiration for this challenge came from Inktober and Tidy Tuesday, aiming to foster a community of map enthusiasts.
